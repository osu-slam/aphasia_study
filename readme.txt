% QUESTIONS

Will we have a training block? -- Mock scanner
How long should the silent period be? How much time do we give her to
  perform the task? Keep in mind we need to jitter stimuli onset. 
How many blocks (4)? Trials?
Should we show instructions?
Other than verbal responses and timing for the MRI data analysis, what should we collect?
"New stimuli" -- what if TW takes more time to respond than is allotted in the silent period?
