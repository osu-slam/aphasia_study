I like you.
I'm happy.
Where is the nurse?
Please and thank you.
I want to go.
Where is my cell phone.
I cannot go alone.
I want to play with the puppy.
I am hot.
I'm busy.
What is this place?
I am sleepy.
Why are you here?
My room has flowers.
I want to read a book.
I like to sit on the sofa.
Spom blems pum sabby.
Selve munnys wab.
