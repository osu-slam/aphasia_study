Won't you stay?
I'm happy.
I found a dime.
Tie my shoe please.
I want to go.
I need a tissue.
This is my favorite one.
I want to play with the puppy.
Time for bed.
I'm trying.
What is this place?
It is springtime.
Why are you here?
My room is tidy.
I want to read a book.
I like to sit on the sofa.
Tim porgs vorp tinny.
Lyme pines try to dine.
